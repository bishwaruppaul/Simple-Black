# Simple-Black
A simple plank theme

Modified from the Mac Black theme by MADCAP in gnome-look.org (https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1215851/)

Modifications involve - 
  1. Lower transparency and darker colours for better visibility in white backgrounds or windows.
  2. Bigger item indicator for better visibility of open apps.
  3. Rounded top corners for better aesthetics.
